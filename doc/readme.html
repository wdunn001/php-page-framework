<p><br />
  potential future developer firstly I am sorry this is convoluded I know.<br />
  Secondly its not as crazy as it looks even for a simple page</p>
<p>some notes:<br />
  the page relies on a url rewrite in the web.config to redirect links.<br />
  and .php file can be called with a link with just the filename and not the extension it will automaticly insert the page title (exchanging _ for spaces and add .php when looking for the file. </p>
<p>This site is the equivalent to the asp.net site master system and works in the same general way.</p>
<p>whats actually happening is the index.php is always being called and the accompanied php files are loaded into a get so like home is actually index.php?page=home.php when inserted into a link. </p>
<p>SUPER IMPORTANT:<br />
  external links have to be fully fleshed so like www.contosco.com isnt going to cut it its gotta be http://www.contosco.com/ or the rewrite might try to load it in a variable. for local resources this isnt an issue as long as they are in a tag. I.E. img src=blah/blah/foo.jpg</p>
<p>the index sets variables and fixes the title and includes the master the site master includes a header and a footer and menu plus whatever page is called</p>
<p>so it works like this </p>
<p>Index.php<br />
  |<br />
  |<br />
  | 			   Header<br />
  |        		 |<br />
  |   			 |<br />
  master ----Menu----Page<br />
  |<br />
  |<br />
  Footer<br />
  so any php file you create in the root will automaticly have all these elements</p>
<p>the header contains all the java and css includes</p>
